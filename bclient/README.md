# bclient

[Github Repo](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bclient)

A client for communicating with bcoin.
Be sure to be on the same docker network as bcoin
for this to work. By default, the container runs `bash`
as a command, so it can be used to drop into a shell
or be passed an individual `bclient` command to run.
